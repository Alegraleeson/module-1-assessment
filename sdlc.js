// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which developers determine what is needed in the project or what the requirements of the project are."
const design = "This is the third step, in which developers determine which technologies to use for the project."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers actually build the project."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which developers test each part of the project and integrate it all together."
const maintain = "This is the last step, in which developers maintain the project by fixing anything that goes wrong."
